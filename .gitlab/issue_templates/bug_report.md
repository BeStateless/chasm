<!--
Please read and abide by the code of conduct at https://gitlab.com/isopod-cloud/chasm/-/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md?ref_type=heads

If you haven't already done so, please also take a moment to search the issues to see if someone has already made an
issue like the one you're here to make. Adding your supporting detail there will both help keep thing organized and also
help make sure that it's obvious that several people are interested in the same issue.

Also, before posting your bug and if you can, try upgrading. Your particular issue may have been recently fixed.
Moreover, even if the bug were to be fixed, it would be fixed in a newer version, not an old one.

If what you're posting is information about a security vulnerability and would like to communicate with the project
discretely please send your bug report (using this template) to security@isopod.cloud.

Lastly, PLEASE STOP AND CHECK WHAT YOU'RE POSTING FOR SECRETS OR INTERNAL DATA!
You wouldn't want to accidentally post a password or the name of a secret project before you're ready. Taking an extra
minute to check what you're posting will save you a lot of hassle later.
