# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

Welcome to Isopod Chasm! We are excited you are here, and you're encouraged to come join us, if you haven't already. We are commited towards an open, friendly, safe, diverse, inclusive, respectful, collaborative, and welcoming environment to all humans, isopods, and other sentient beings, regardless of age, race, relgion, ethnicity, sex-characteristics, body-type, or number of walking legs, antennae, or jaws. However, with that said, we do need to go over some rules towards fulfilling this commitment. We exhibit behavior towards the Five S's in everything we do unless restricted by State of Colorado legal means or isopods' deep sea habitats. These Five S's are: Supportive, Sincere, Striving, Studious, and Stateless.

## Our Values

As you look to contribute here, please bear in mind our values, the 5 S's, and hold us accountable to them as well.

- **Supportive**: Be understanding and encouraging of your teammates regardless of their identity. Give others the benefit of the doubt, solve the problem _and_ build the relationship. Be kind, considerate, polite, and helpful.
- **Sincere**: Be honest with yourself, your colleages, and your customers. Provide feedback when things are bad and when they're good, raise issues with the people who are able to help with them. Be open, respectful, and compassionate.
- **Studious**: Be serious and accountable for your work. Invest in understanding the problem. Communicate your intent, and execute deliberately. Commit to the result you want, and own the outcome.
- **Striving**: Always work to improve. Recognize when there is room for improvement, and develop the skills to better the situation. Look for the positive outcome, and work together towards it with the right attitude.
- **Stateless**: Be adaptable. Be open minded, and willing to try new things. Be willing to iterate, and comfortable with getting started when things are still ambiguous. Be informed and passionate, but flexible - strong opinions, weakly held.

## Our Standards

Behaviors that contribute towards a positive environment happen to reflect our values from the previous section. These include, but aren't limited to:

- Focusing on what is best not just for individuals, but for the overall community. Ie, We are all trying to build the ultimate product together!
- Gracefully giving and accepting constructive feedback. Ie, Sometimes feedback is difficult to receive, but we encourage you to provide constructive and sincere feedback, and consider feedback as an investment from our community to you!
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience, for purposes of improving. Ie, we are all trying to get better at what we are doing, and nobody is born with it, not even the folks at Stateless!
- Exhibiting a willingness to learn new things, with kindness and empathy towards others in doing so. Ie, you never stop learning when you really think of it, and can often pick things up from the least likeliest of cafe corners, so make sure to take the time to be thankful and kind to others for this opportunity!
- Respecting differences in viewpoints, opinions, and experiences. Ie, there is no one perfect viewpoint, opinion, experience, or "state", and they all have their advantages and disadvantages. Therefore better to "stay flexible", or the alternate way of stating this phrase... Be Stateless!!!

Examples of unacceptable behaviors include, but aren't limited to:

- Sexualized language or imagery, and sexual/romantic attention or advances. Ie, this isn't the community of Glenn Quagmire!
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks. Ie, remember, we're trying to make our little village friendly and inclusive, so being mean will not be tolerated!
- Public or private harassment. Ie, don't slow-follow our staff everywhere with your car, and don't insult folks on our forums based on intrinsic traits (nationality, disability, etc)!
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission. Ie, seriously, would you want us publishing your email or credit card number without your permission for the world to see? So don't do that to anyone else here, ya dig?!
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting. Ie, no NSFW Content, and no violating third-party platforms interfacing with us!

## Our Responsibilities

Designated Community Leaders:

- Are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. Ie, Community Leaders are held to a higher standard than other members since they are required to keep our standards in mind for all their actions!
- Will take appropriate fair corrective actions to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Ie, our community isn't your own private home, everyone can see the negative behavior, so one of our Leaders will be forced to take action!
- May remove, edit, or reject comments, code, wiki edits, issues, or contributions unaligned to the Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for this when appropriate. Ie, if you name a variable in code something unprofessional like "sexyDude", a Community Leader reserves the right to edit it and communicate to you why they had to do so!

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of this representation include project email addresses, posts via an official social media account, or acting as appointed representative at an online or offline event. Ie, all email, Instragram, etc communication falls under Code of Conduct, along with other Stateless-associated forums, as well as representing us at a tech conference!

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, Code of Conduct violations, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at abuse@isopod.cloud. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All Designated Community Leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Ie, if you see someone breaking the rules, please report it, and we will deal fairly and respectfully with it!

## Enforcement

Participants and Community Leaders who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the Community Leadership. Ie, if you're breaking the rules, then you might be temporarily censored or permanently banned, even if you're a Community Leader!
